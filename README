BEMT code written specifically for low Reynolds number small propellers in axial and edgewise forward flight.

- Prandtl tip-loss function
- Mach number corrections to lift coefficient
- Profile power calculations with radial velocity component considerations
- Cl and Cd are obtained for low Re airfoils by pre computing values as a function of Reynolds number and AoA, for
  instance by using a code such as Xfoil.
- Currently only uniform inflow is implemented for the forward flight case computed using momentum theory.
- Supports arbitrary chord and twist distributions via the propeller class.

This code is still in development.
